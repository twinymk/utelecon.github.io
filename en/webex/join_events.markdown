* Set the audio and microphone settings in the lower right section of the preview screen. Here, you can change the settings of the equipment to use the audio and microphone. Even if you cannot correctly change the settings, you can change it after joining the meeting.
	 * Check if the microphone sounds good. If the indicator below the microphone responds when you make a sound, that means the microphone is picking up the sound.
* The microphone button in the screen mutes / unmutes your microphone. It is unmuted by the default setting.
* You can join the event by selecting "Attend Event".
* If the host has not joined yet, you will not be able to participate even if the time has run over the starting time.
