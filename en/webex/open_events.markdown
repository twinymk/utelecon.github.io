## Start an event
* **To start an event, the organizer must resume it.**
* The scheduled event will be displayed on the home screen; press the "Start" button of the corresponding event. A preview screen will be displayed. Once you check the connected devices and audio, you can start immediately with the "Start the event" button.

* Participants will not be able to join the meeting, even a scheduled one, until the organizer clicks "Start the Event" and starts the meeting.．
