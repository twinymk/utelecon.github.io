	* Press "Schedule Event" to create an event and display information such as the URL.
	* Panelists are responsible for organizing and presenting during the event.
		* Provide panelists with the event address or the event number and the password. Panelists can also connect from a video conference system (Polycom, etc.). Give the video address and the password for the panelists.
		* For other participants, give the participant's address or the event number and event password.
		* The host key is used to return as the host when re connecting to a meeting if the host is disconnected due to a connection problem. Only share the host key to those who may become organizers of the event.
