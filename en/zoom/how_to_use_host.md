## How to set additional functions and recommended settings
By setting configurations individually, you can use additional functions such as "voting" for asking questions to participants and "breakout" for discussing in groups. 
Therefore, here we will introduce how to set additional functions and recommended settings.
  
1. Go to Zoom account <a href="https://zoom.us/profile/setting" target="_blank">settings page</a> (Personal “Settings” → “Meeting”).
  * Please log in with the account you obtained from school

1. Turn on the required settings. Recommended settings are as follows.
  * （ON when necessary）**Only authenticated users can join the meeting**: If you turn this on and select "Sign in with University Account", access will be restricted to those with an ECCS cloud email (xxxx@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac. jp) 
  * （ON recommended）**Chat auto save**: When turned on, the chat will be saved automatically（otherwise, the chat text will not be kept unless you save it manually）.

  * （ON recommended）**Polls**:  The organizer can ask questions to the participants (more on this later).
  * （ON recommended）**Breakout room**: Divides participants into subgroups to encourage discussion and work (more on this later).
  * （ON when necessary）**Subtitle function**: It can be used when you want to supplement audio with text.


## Organizer-specific menu
  
Here is a brief description of the menus specific to the organizer.

  1. **Participant management** : You can mute a participant, mute all participants, prevent participants from unmuting themselves, or lock a meeting so that there are no more participants.
  1. **Polls（setting required）** : Allows participants to respond to polls. The questions themselves need to be created with a web browser, and you can create a question by pressing "Edit" or "Add question", when you are creating a question for the first time.
  1. **Recording** : You can record the state of the meeting.
  1. **Breakout（setting required）** : Participants can be divided into subgroups. You can decide the number of people and assign them automatically, or you can assign them manually.
