This section describes how to create a Zoom conference room using a Web browser（Reference: [Reserve a room (meeting room) where the URL used for all 13 lessons does not change](how_to_use_in_classroom_faculty_members#schedule)）．  

１．Open a web browser and goo to the <a href="https://zoom.us/profile" target="_blank"> Zoom my account</a>page(if you are not signed in, sign in with your Zoom account),and press "Schedule a Meeting" on the top right.  ![ミーティングのスケジュール開始](img/zoom_create_room_browser_1_schedule.png)

The following is a supplementary explanation focusing on points that are particularly necessary.  

  * **Recurring meeting**: Allows you to schedule daily, weekly or monthly meetings.（Reference: [Reserve a room (meeting room) where the URL used for all 13 lessons does not change](how_to_use_in_classroom_faculty_members#schedule)）．
  * **Meeting password**: You can set a password, but, by default, the password information is already embedded in the URL. Even if you set a password, participants can enter the meeting room by clicking on the URL you have shared.
  * **Meeting options**:  
    * **Enable participation before host**: When unchecked, no other participants can enter the conference room without the host. It is recommended to turn it on if you wish to allow other participants enter early. 
    * **Mute participants when entering**: Recommended to turn on when you want to give a one-way explanation at first.
    * **Only authenticated users can join**: If you check "Only authenticated users can join meetings" in the <a href="https://zoom.us/profile/setting" target="_blank">Zoom user settings</a>において, no one will be able to enter the meeting without accessing it with one of the school accounts（i.e., the access becomes limited to users with the g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp domain．Still, the domain can be edited by the meeting host）. However, all participants need to sign in with the University's Zoom account, so turning this function off is recommended unless you are familiar with it.  

３．After saving, copy the **invitation URL** and send it by email to the participants.

  * By default, the **URL contains password information**, so there is no need to share a separate password even if you have set a password.
  * The text obtained from "Copy Invitation" contains not necessarily vital information (such as how to participate over the phone),**so we recommend that you share ONLY the URL of the meeting room** instead of copying the whole invitation. 
  * If you have scheduled a recurring meeting, you can set an exceptional date and time setting by pressing “Show All Scheduled Items”（ex. you have a recurring meeting for Tuesdays, but will have an extra class on the next Thursday).
